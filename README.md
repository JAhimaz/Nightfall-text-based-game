# NIGHTFALL

#### About NightFall
Nightfall takes the apocalypse survival genre back to gamings roots by using text based choices to decide the faith of the settlement with RNG being a heavy factor.

#### Current Features (Development 1.0.3)
Current complete features that are working (Does not mean finished).

Day to Day System:
- Days pass by after a turn/action has been made. such as sending out scavengers, going to the market, fortifying your base or just skipping in general.
- Different Seasons affect the gameplay, amount of water/food your settlers need.

Random Events:
- 10% Rain (Acid (15%) / Normal(75%) ) - Acid rain affects the water units while normal rain adds to it.
- 5% Attacked by invaders. Damaging your defenses and possibly killing some settlers. (Although a reward of weapons and possibly surrendered invaders join your settlement).

Scavenging:
- The player is able to send out scavengers as long as he has the required amount of settlers (min. 2 in settlement at any given time).
- Scavengers take a random amount of days (1-5) out in the wasteland and come back with food, water, metal, wood.

Settler System:
- Giving each individual settler their own stats/gender/name and perks.
- Choice to send out certain settlers to the wasteland depending on their skills.

Removal of overall health:
- As each settler will have their own health, I've chosen to remove the health of the overall settlement and instead keep it just with defenses.

#### Currently Working On Features (Development 1.0.4)

Scavenging System Experience
- Scavenging now awards the player with experience that allows him to send out more scavengers, and increases scavenging loot!
